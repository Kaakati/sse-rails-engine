This engine is designed to allow Server-Sent Events to be broadcast to all listeners from anywhere
in your Rails app.

# Installation
```
gem 'sse-rails-engine'
```

# Usage

Mount the engine in your ```config/routes.rb```:
```
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount SseRailsEngine::Engine, at: '/sse'
end
```

To use, initialize the connection on the client side, so add the following javascript:
```
$(document).ready(function () {
  var source = new EventSource('/sse');

  source.addEventListener('test', function(e) {
    // Do something
  }, true);
});

```

Then you can send an event from anywhere in your app:
```
    SseRailsEngine.manager.send_event('test', { foo: 'bar' })
```
